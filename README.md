# Automatic-Art-Defect-Detection
Python code to automatically detect defects (i.e., cracks, bumps, overlap, etc.) on .TIF files of OCT scans. \
\
\
How to Use: 
* Open the files using your preferred Python code editor*.

* Input .TIF file location.

* Run the code. 

>\* I use Spyder through the Anaconda application. You will need to download tifffle through the Anaconda Prompt terminal. \
